# Circuits

A Python program and library that allows the simulation of technological
evolution using logic circuits as a proxy for actual technologies. Based on the
work of Arthur and Polak [1].

We expect to use the program in two ways.  First, we will replicate the results
of Arthur and Polak.  Second, this program will be a component in a larger
simulation of the role of social communication in technological innovation.

computer model,” Complexity, vol. 11, no. 5, pp. 23–31, 2006.
